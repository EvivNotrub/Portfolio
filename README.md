# gh-pages dependency, Deployment & Caveats:

commit 762f7b7c15f7b7fe920f452c37b4a76e1985a339 had an older version with readme indications and tutorial followed.

Changes made after some reading of vite documentation, different script in package.json indicate now the base required, and "basename" for Router gets the value import.meta.env.BASE_URL => it works in both development and two build options: local and gh-pages.
